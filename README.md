## 🌍 What is PDPR?

**PDPR (Public Dark Pattern Registry)** is a global, open-source public infrastructure dedicated to exposing, documenting, and neutralizing manipulative user-interface practices known as **dark patterns**.

Instead of public shaming or legal battles, PDPR focuses on:

- Education  
- Awareness  
- Scientific detection  
- Ethical transparency  
- Public digital literacy  

This project aims to **immunize society against manipulation**, not merely punish it.

> **Consumer protection through literacy, not litigation.**

## 🧠 Why PDPR Exists

Dark patterns exploit cognitive biases to manipulate users into:

- Giving consent unknowingly  
- Paying more than intended  
- Sharing excessive data  
- Subscribing unwillingly  
- Remaining trapped in platforms  

Most users **feel** manipulated but cannot **explain how**.

PDPR provides:

- Clear explanations  
- Pattern breakdowns  
- Psychological context  
- Defensive strategies  

So people can **recognize, understand, and resist manipulation.**
